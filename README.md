# VibeEmu

This project is a Game Boy Color emulator named VibeEmu written in Rust.

## Current State

The project is in the early stages of development, with a focus on implementing the core components of the Game Boy Color such as the CPU, PPU, memory management, and other peripherals. It is an ongoing effort to bring the classic handheld gaming experience to modern platforms.

This project is meant for fun where Jules.google.com is writing the majority of the code 'vibe coding' as a fun experiment on asynchronous AI coding agents.
